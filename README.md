#Go-genders
An opinionated example library which understands that gender is mutable, not strictly defined, and not exclusive. Demonstrates a possible method for implementing a gender-releated datastructure in a codebase that respects its trans and cis users alike, as well as those for whom english is not a first language. I am not a linguist, so some field names may be a bit inaccurate, but this is more for demonstration purposes than actual implementation.

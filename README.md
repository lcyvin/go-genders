# Go-genders

An opinionated example library which understands that gender is mutable, not strictly defined, and not exclusive. Demonstrates a possible method for implementing a gender-releated datastructure in a codebase that respects its trans and cis users alike, as well as those for whom english is not a first language. I am not a linguist, so some field names may be a bit inaccurate, but this is more for demonstration purposes than actual implementation.

I made this mostly to force people to ask an important and simple question: do you even need this?
Are you building a project and thinking about adding a gender field? Have you considered not doing that? What is the harm if you don't? If you must, have you considered the following?

- Gender is mutable
- Gender is experiential, it is different for everyone who experiences (or doesn't) it
- Gender is not simple and also gender is simple. There's depth in places you likely never considered.
- Have you asked a single trans person about how you have planned to handle gender?
